what's included:

<img src="./nvim/.config/nvim/preview.png">

#### `qtile/`
my qtile configuration
<img src="./qtile/.config/qtile/preview.png">

#### `bin/`
my collection of scripts with very short names

#### `other/`
this shouldn't bother you. they exist simply to save me some time when im starting from scratch
